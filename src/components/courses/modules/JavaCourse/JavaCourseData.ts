          'Learn why Java is the language of choice for large-scale enterprise backends.',
          'Explore the concept of backward compatibility and community support.'
        ],
        theory: 'Welcome to the world of Java programming! Java is a highly popular, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. First released in 1995 by Sun Microsystems, Java has evolved into one of the most reliable and widely used programming languages in the world. Java powers a vast ecosystem, ranging from enterprise-scale web applications, cloud-native services, and big data infrastructure to Android apps, financial transaction systems, and embedded devices. The core value proposition of Java is its high reliability, secure runtime environment, backward compatibility, and massive global community. With its strong type safety, automatic memory management (garbage collection), and extensive standard library, Java helps developers build robust, scalable applications that can run on virtually any platform without modification.',
        takeaways: [
          'Java is a mature, production-proven language powering enterprise backends, Android apps, and financial systems globally.',

          'Understand how Java combines compilation and interpretation for cross-platform execution.',
          'Learn the role of the JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler in performance optimization.'
        ],
        theory: 'Java is unique because it is both a compiled and an interpreted language. When you write code in Java, it is saved in a `.java` source file. Rather than compiling directly into machine code that runs on a specific operating system, the Java compiler (`javac`) compiles the source code into an intermediate format called bytecode, which is saved in a `.class` file. Bytecode is a highly optimized set of instructions that is neutral to the platform. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) then reads and interprets this bytecode, executing it on the underlying operating system. This compilation-interpretation hybrid model gives Java its characteristic cross-platform portability. Additionally, modern JVMs utilize Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to compile hot sections of bytecode directly into native machine code at runtime, providing near-native execution performance.',
        takeaways: [
          'Java source code is compiled into platform-neutral bytecode.',
          'Bytecode is executed on the target machine by the Java Virtual Machine.',

          'Learn about the evolution of Java versions and the modern LTS release cycle.'
        ],
        theory: 'Java was initiated by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton in June 1991 as part of the \'Green Project\' at Sun Microsystems. Initially designed for interactive television and consumer digital devices, the language was originally named Oak (after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling\'s office), and later renamed Green. Ultimately, it was named \'Java\' (inspired by Java coffee, which the team consumed in large quantities). The first public implementation, Java 1.0, was released in 1995 under the promise of \'Write Once, Run Anywhere\' (WORA). In 2010, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems, taking over ownership and stewardship of Java. Today, Java follows a strict release cycle, with a new version released every six months and Long-Term Support (LTS) versions released every two years (such as Java 11, 17, and 21).',

        theory: 'Java\'s success is due to several core design features:\n\n1. **Simple**: Java syntax is easy to learn and write, clean, and avoids complex features like explicit pointers, operator overloading, and multiple inheritance of classes.\n2. **Object-Oriented**: Everything in Java is an object (except primitive types), promoting modularity, reusability, and clean architecture.\n3. **Platform-Independent**: Compilation to bytecode allows Java programs to run on any computer that has a JVM.\n4. **Secure**: Java code runs inside a virtual sandbox, preventing direct access to physical memory and hardware unless permitted.\n5. **Robust**: Strong type checking, exception handling, and automatic garbage collection eliminate memory leaks and common runtime crashes.\n6. **Multithreaded**: Java has built-in support for writing programs that can execute multiple tasks concurrently, maximizing CPU utilization.',

        ],
        theory: 'To develop and run Java programs, you must understand the relationship between the JDK, JRE, and JVM:\n\n1. **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: The core engine that loads, verifies, compiles, and executes Java bytecode on a specific hardware platform. The JVM itself is platform-dependent because it must translate bytecode into machine-specific instructions.\n2. **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: A software package that contains the JVM, core libraries, and support files necessary to run compiled Java applications. It does not contain development tools like compilers.\n3. **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: A complete software development environment that includes the JRE, along with developers\' tools such as the compiler (`javac`), archiver (`jar`), and debugger. If you want to write Java code, you need the JDK; if you only want to run it, the JRE is sufficient.',
        syntax: 'JDK (Java Development Kit) = JRE + Development Tools (javac, jar, jdb, etc.)\nJRE (Java Runtime Environment) = JVM + Class Libraries + Support Files\nJVM (Java Virtual Machine) = Execution Engine + Bytecode Verifier + Class Loader',

        theory: 'To start coding in Java, you need to install a Java Development Kit (JDK). Today, there are many builds of OpenJDK available, such as Eclipse Temurin (by Adoptium), Amazon Corretto, Microsoft Build of OpenJDK, or Oracle\'s official JDK. It is highly recommended to install a Long-Term Support (LTS) version, such as JDK 17 or JDK 21.\n\n**Installation Steps:**\n1. Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) from a trusted distributor (e.g., Adoptium).\n2. Run the installer and follow the prompt instructions.\n3. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the JDK installation directory.\n4. Update your system `PATH` variable to include the JDK `bin` directory. This allows you to run `java` and `javac` commands from any terminal window.\n\n**Verification:** Open a terminal and run `java -version` and `javac -version` to confirm successful installation.',

        theory: 'While you can write Java code in a simple text editor and compile it via the command line, using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) significantly boosts productivity. The two most popular choices are:\n\n1. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: A lightweight, extensible editor. To write Java, install the \'Extension Pack for Java\' from Microsoft, which includes support for code completion, debugging, project management, and automated test runners.\n2. **IntelliJ IDEA**: The industry-standard IDE developed by JetBrains specifically for Java. The free \'Community Edition\' is highly powerful, providing intelligent code completion, deep static code analysis, built-in version control, refactoring tools, and integrated build tools.\n\nIn this course, we recommend starting with a clean workspace folder to organize your packages, class files, and build configurations.',

Next come import statements, which allow you to reference classes outside the current package (e.g., `import java.util.ArrayList;`). Following this is the class definition. In Java, all executable code must reside inside a class. Inside this class, you declare member variables (state) and methods (behavior). Note that if a class is declared public, it must be defined in a file matching its exact name (with a `.java` extension). Proper indentation, camelCase formatting for methods/variables, and TitleCase formatting for classes are critical best practices that ensure readability in team environments.',

Everything following `//` on that line is ignored.\n2. **Multi-line comments**: Wrapped inside `/*` and `*/`. This is useful for writing multi-line explanations or temporarily disabling blocks of code.\n3. **JavaDoc comments**: Wrapped inside `/**` and `*/`. These are specialized comments placed before classes, variables, or methods that can be extracted automatically by the `javadoc` tool to build interactive HTML developer API documentations.',

Instantiation or initialization assigns a starting value to that variable.\n\nVariables in Java have defined scopes:\n- **Local variables**: Declared inside a method, only accessible inside that method, and must be initialized before first use.\n- **Instance variables**: Declared inside a class but outside any method, representing object properties.\n- **Static variables**: Declared with the `static` keyword, shared among all instances of a class.',

Use these for images, PDFs, and any binary format.\n- **Character streams** (`Reader` / `Writer`) move text and handle character encoding for you. Use these for `.txt`, `.csv`, `.json`.\n\nThe `java.io.File` class does **not** hold file contents. It is a handle describing a *path*, which may or may not point at something that exists. You use it to test existence, read metadata, create empty files, and delete them.\n\nModern Java also offers `java.nio.file.Path` and `Files`, which are more capable; `File` remains the gentlest introduction and is still ubiquitous in existing codebases.",

For line-oriented text most developers reach for `Scanner`, which offers the familiar `hasNextLine()` / `nextLine()` pair, or `BufferedReader` (covered in Lesson 11.4) when throughput matters.\n\nWhatever you use, the stream holds an operating-system file handle.

Truncating a log file by accident is one of the most common beginner mistakes in Java I/O.\n\n**Buffering.** Writes are held in memory and only pushed to disk when the buffer fills, when you call `flush()`, or when you `close()`. If your program exits without closing, the buffered text is silently lost.

Every Java object owns a *monitor*; entering a synchronized block acquires it and exiting releases it. Only one thread can hold a given monitor at a time, so the protected region becomes mutually exclusive. You can synchronize a whole method (locking `this`, or the Class object for static methods) or a narrower block on a specific lock object — the narrower the region, the less contention.\n\n**`volatile`** solves a different problem: **visibility**. Without it a thread may cache a field in a CPU register and never see another thread's update, causing an infinite loop. `volatile` forces reads and writes to go to main memory. It does *not* make compound operations like `++` atomic — for counters use `AtomicInteger`.\n\nA **deadlock** occurs when two threads each hold a lock the other needs.

Before Java 8 this required a verbose anonymous inner class; a lambda reduces the same idea to a single line.\n\nThe form is `(parameters) -> body`. Parameter types are usually inferred, so `(String s) -> s.length()` shortens to `s -> s.length()`. A single-expression body implicitly returns its value; a braced body needs an explicit `return`.\n\nA lambda can only be assigned to a **functional interface** — an interface with exactly one abstract method (covered next lesson). The compiler matches the lambda's shape to that method's signature.\n\nOne important rule: a lambda may reference local variables from its enclosing scope only if they are **final or effectively final** (never reassigned after initialisation). This is because the value is captured by copy, and allowing mutation would make the captured state ambiguous.

Each returns a new stream and is **lazy**: nothing executes yet.\n3. **Terminal operation** — `collect`, `forEach`, `count`, `reduce`, `anyMatch`, `findFirst`. This triggers the work and consumes the stream.\n\nLaziness matters for performance. In `list.stream().filter(...).findFirst()`, the filter runs only until the first match is found, not across the whole collection.\n\nTwo rules to internalise. First, a stream can be consumed **only once** — reusing it throws `IllegalStateException`. Second, streams should be **non-interfering**: do not modify the source collection while a pipeline over it is running, or you risk `ConcurrentModificationException`.\n\n`parallelStream()` splits work across the common ForkJoinPool.

Its central idea is *abstraction*: your code is written against interfaces in `java.sql`, and a vendor-supplied **driver** implements them. Swap MySQL for PostgreSQL and, in principle, only the connection URL and the dependency change.\n\nThe architecture has four layers:\n\n1. **Your application** — calls JDBC interfaces.\n2. **The JDBC API** (`java.sql`) — `Connection`, `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, `ResultSet`. All interfaces, no implementation.\n3. **The driver** — a JAR such as `mysql-connector-j` or `postgresql`, which implements those interfaces over the database's wire protocol.\n4. **The database**.\n\nModern drivers are **Type 4**: pure Java, talking the native protocol directly with no native libraries or bridges. Since JDBC 4.0 drivers register themselves automatically via the service-loader mechanism, so the old `Class.forName(\"com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\")` incantation is no longer needed.\n\nAlmost every JDBC method throws the checked `SQLException`, so error handling is not optional.",

Without it the driver cannot register and `getConnection` fails.\n\n**The URL** follows the shape `jdbc:<subprotocol>://<host>:<port>/<database>?<params>`:\n\n- MySQL — `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/school?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC`\n- PostgreSQL — `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/school`\n- H2 in-memory (ideal for tests) — `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`\n\n**Credentials.** Never hard-code a username and password into a class that goes into version control.

Leaked database credentials in public repositories are a routine cause of breaches.\n\nOne more production note: opening a connection is expensive — a TCP handshake plus authentication, often tens of milliseconds.

Databases cap concurrent connections (MySQL defaults to 151); leak enough and every subsequent request fails. `try-with-resources` is the correct default because it closes the connection even when an exception is thrown.\n\nBy default a connection is in **auto-commit** mode: each statement commits immediately.

It returns an `int` — the number of rows affected. Always check it: a return of `0` means your `WHERE` clause matched nothing, which is very often the actual bug rather than a thrown exception.\n- **`executeQuery()`** for SELECT.

Ask for it with `prepareStatement(sql, Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS)` and read it from `getGeneratedKeys()`.\n\nFor bulk work, **batching** is transformative. `addBatch()` queues statements and `executeBatch()` sends them in one network round trip; inserting a thousand rows one at a time versus in a batch is often a hundredfold difference.\n\nGood practice is to put all of this behind a **DAO** (Data Access Object) so SQL never leaks into business logic.",

If any part of that string came from a user, the user controls your query. Given\n\n```\n\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '\" + input + \"'\"\n```\n\na user who types `' OR '1'='1` turns the query into one that matches every row. Type `'; DROP TABLE users; --` and the table is gone. This is **SQL injection**, and it has topped the OWASP risk list for two decades.\n\n`PreparedStatement` eliminates it structurally. The SQL is sent to the database **first**, with `?` placeholders, and parsed into an execution plan. Values are then bound separately as **data**. Because the query structure is already fixed before any user value arrives, no input can alter it. A malicious string is simply searched for literally and matches nothing.\n\nTwo bonuses come along for free: the database can cache and reuse the compiled plan, so repeated execution is faster; and setters like `setDate` and `setString` handle escaping and type conversion for you.\n\nThe one gotcha worth memorising: **parameter indexes start at 1, not 0.**",

Address a column by **name** (`rs.getString(\"name\")`) for readability, or by 1-based index for a marginal speed gain.\n\n**SQL NULL needs care.** Primitive getters cannot represent it, so `getInt` on a NULL column returns `0` and `getDouble` returns `0.0` — indistinguishable from a genuine zero. To tell them apart, call the getter and then `rs.wasNull()`. For object getters like `getString` you simply get `null` back.\n\nA `ResultSet` is tied to its `Statement` and its `Connection`. Close the statement or the connection and the cursor dies, so **never return a live ResultSet from a DAO method**.

The **height** is the longest root-to-leaf path.\n\nA **binary tree** allows at most two children per node. A **binary search tree** (BST) adds the ordering invariant that makes it useful:\n\n> everything in the left subtree is smaller than the node; everything in the right subtree is larger.\n\nThat invariant lets you discard half the remaining tree at every comparison, giving **O(log n)** search, insert and delete — provided the tree is balanced.\n\nThe catch: inserting already-sorted data produces a tree where every node has one child. It has degenerated into a linked list and every operation is **O(n)**. Self-balancing variants such as **AVL** and **red-black trees** rotate on insertion to keep the height logarithmic. Java's `TreeMap` and `TreeSet` are red-black trees, which is why they guarantee O(log n).\n\nThree depth-first traversals, each named for when the node itself is visited:\n\n- **In-order** (left, node, right) — on a BST this emits elements **in sorted order**.\n- **Pre-order** (node, left, right) — used to copy or serialise a tree.\n- **Post-order** (left, right, node) — used to delete a tree, children first.\n\nThere is also **level-order** (breadth-first), which uses a queue and visits the tree row by row.",

On an unweighted graph it finds the **shortest path** in edges — that guarantee is its whole point.\n- **DFS** (depth-first) uses a **stack**, or recursion, and follows one branch to its end before backtracking.

For small or unsorted data it is the right answer.\n\n**Binary search** requires **sorted** data and repeatedly halves the search space. Compare the middle element: equal means found, smaller means discard the left half, larger means discard the right. Each step eliminates half the candidates, giving **O(log n)**.\n\nThe difference is dramatic. Searching a million sorted elements takes at most 20 comparisons instead of a million.\n\nBut the precondition is absolute: **on unsorted data binary search returns garbage, silently**. It does not throw. If you must sort first, that is O(n log n), so a single search is not worth it — binary search pays off when you search the same sorted data repeatedly.\n\nTwo implementation details separate correct code from subtly broken code:\n\n1. **Overflow.** Writing `(low + high) / 2` can overflow `int` for very large arrays. The correct form is `low + (high - low) / 2`. This bug lived in the JDK's own binary search for nine years.\n2. **Loop condition.** It must be `low <= high`, not `low < high`, or you miss the case where the target is the final remaining element.\n\nIn practice, use `Arrays.binarySearch` or `Collections.binarySearch`.

With an early-exit flag it is O(n) on already-sorted input.\n- **Selection sort** finds the minimum and swaps it into place. Always O(n²), but makes only O(n) swaps — useful when writes are expensive.\n- **Insertion sort** builds a sorted prefix one element at a time. Genuinely fast on small or nearly-sorted arrays, which is why real libraries fall back to it below ~47 elements.\n\n**The efficient O(n log n) sorts:**\n\n- **Merge sort** splits, sorts each half recursively, and merges. Guaranteed O(n log n) in every case and **stable**, but needs O(n) extra space.\n- **Quicksort** partitions around a pivot and recurses. O(n log n) average with O(log n) space and excellent constants, but O(n²) worst case if pivots are chosen badly. Randomised or median-of-three pivots make that essentially impossible.\n\n**Stability** means equal elements keep their original relative order. It matters when you sort by one key and then another — sort by name, then stably by department, and within each department names remain alphabetical.\n\nWhat Java actually does: `Arrays.sort` on **primitives** uses dual-pivot quicksort (fast, not stable — irrelevant for primitives). On **objects** it uses TimSort, a merge/insertion hybrid that is stable and exploits existing runs. `Collections.sort` delegates to the same TimSort.",

It is powerful but historically demanded enormous configuration — XML files, servlet descriptors, manual bean wiring. A \"hello world\" REST service could take an afternoon.\n\n**Spring Boot** is Spring with opinions. It keeps the framework and removes the ceremony, through three ideas:\n\n1. **Auto-configuration.** Boot inspects your classpath and configures sensible defaults. Find `spring-boot-starter-web` on the classpath and it configures an embedded Tomcat, a `DispatcherServlet`, and JSON conversion — with no configuration from you. Any default can be overridden.\n2. **Starters.** Curated dependency bundles with versions already reconciled. `spring-boot-starter-web` pulls in Spring MVC, Tomcat, Jackson and validation as one coherent set, eliminating version-conflict debugging.\n3. **Embedded server.** The application packages as a runnable JAR containing its own Tomcat. `java -jar app.jar` is the whole deployment. No external application server to install and configure — which is precisely what makes Boot the natural fit for containers and cloud platforms.\n\nThe entry point is a class annotated `@SpringBootApplication`. That single annotation is a composite of three: `@Configuration` (this class declares beans), `@EnableAutoConfiguration` (turn on the magic), and `@ComponentScan` (discover components in this package and below).\n\nThat last part explains the most common beginner failure: **classes outside the main class's package are never scanned**, so their beans silently do not exist.",

Note the `spring-boot-starter-parent`, which supplies a curated dependency-management section so you never write version numbers for Spring libraries.\n- `src/main/java` — your code, rooted at the package holding the main class.\n- `src/main/resources/application.properties` (or `.yml`) — configuration.\n- `src/test/java` — tests, with `spring-boot-starter-test` already wired up.\n- `mvnw` / `gradlew` — wrapper scripts, so contributors need no local Maven or Gradle install.\n\n`application.properties` is where you set the port, datasource URL, JPA behaviour and logging levels.

Verbs do not belong in URLs — `/getStudent` and `/deleteStudent` are the classic beginner mistake, because the HTTP method already carries the verb.\n\n**The HTTP method is the operation:**\n\n| Method | Purpose | Idempotent | Safe |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| GET | read | yes | yes |\n| POST | create | no | no |\n| PUT | replace whole resource | yes | no |\n| PATCH | update part | no | no |\n| DELETE | remove | yes | no |\n\n*Idempotent* means repeating the call has the same effect as making it once. It matters because clients retry on network failure — a retried DELETE is harmless, a retried POST creates a duplicate.\n\n**Status codes are part of the contract:**\n\n- 200 OK, 201 Created (with a `Location` header), 204 No Content\n- 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorised, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 409 Conflict, 422 Unprocessable\n- 500 Internal Server Error\n\nReturning `200 OK` with `{\"error\": \"not found\"}` in the body defeats the point: clients, proxies and monitoring all key off the status code.\n\n**Statelessness** is the final principle.

Use plain `@Controller` only when rendering server-side templates.\n\n`@RequestMapping` at class level sets a base path; the method-level shortcuts `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, `@PatchMapping` and `@DeleteMapping` add the rest.\n\nFour binding annotations cover almost every case:\n\n- **`@PathVariable`** — a segment of the URL. `/students/{id}` → `@PathVariable Integer id`.\n- **`@RequestParam`** — a query-string parameter. `?page=2` → `@RequestParam int page`. Supports `defaultValue` and `required=false`.\n- **`@RequestBody`** — deserialise the JSON body into an object.\n- **`@RequestHeader`** — read a header such as `Authorization`.\n\nReturn either the object itself (Spring supplies 200) or a **`ResponseEntity<T>`** when you need control over the status code and headers.\n\nThe crucial architectural rule: **controllers should be thin**.

Three concrete reasons:\n\n1. **Reuse.** The same `enrolStudent` logic serves a REST endpoint, a scheduled job, and a CLI command. Logic trapped in a controller is reachable only over HTTP.\n2. **Testability.** A service is a plain object. Unit-testing it means `new StudentService(mockRepo)` — no server, no HTTP, millisecond tests.\n3. **Transaction boundaries.** A business operation often spans several repository calls that must succeed or fail together. The service is the natural place to draw that boundary.\n\n`@Service` marks the class as a Spring-managed bean. Functionally it is `@Component` with a clearer name, but that naming is not cosmetic — it documents the layer and lets tooling and aspects target services specifically.\n\n**`@Transactional`** is the annotation that earns the layer its keep. Spring wraps the method in a database transaction: it commits when the method returns normally and **rolls back automatically on an unchecked exception**. Two behaviours surprise people:\n\n- By default it rolls back on `RuntimeException` and `Error`, but **not on checked exceptions**. Use `@Transactional(rollbackFor = Exception.class)` if you need that.\n- It works by creating a **proxy**, so **calling a `@Transactional` method from another method in the same class bypasses it entirely** — the call never leaves the object, so the proxy never sees it.

This is the usual choice.\n\nThe part that feels like magic is **derived query methods**. Spring parses the *method name* and writes the query for you. `findByGradeAndAgeGreaterThan(String grade, int age)` becomes `SELECT s FROM Student s WHERE s.grade = ?1 AND s.age > ?2`. The vocabulary includes `And`, `Or`, `Between`, `LessThan`, `GreaterThan`, `Like`, `Containing`, `StartingWith`, `In`, `IsNull`, `OrderBy`, `Top`, `First`, `Distinct`.\n\nBecause the name *is* the query, **the property names in the method must match the entity's fields exactly**. A typo fails at application startup, not at runtime — noisy, but far better than silently wrong data.\n\nWhen a name would become unreadable, switch to **`@Query`** and write JPQL (which operates on entities) or native SQL (`nativeQuery = true`). Any modifying query needs `@Modifying` and must run inside a transaction.\n\nOne performance trap worth knowing early: the **N+1 select problem**.

        "theory": "**Inversion of Control** is the idea at the heart of Spring. Normally an object creates what it needs: `this.repo = new StudentRepository()`. That hard-codes the dependency — you cannot substitute a mock in a test or swap the implementation without editing the class.\n\nIoC inverts it. The object *declares* what it needs and the framework supplies it. **Dependency Injection** is how Spring performs that supply.\n\nThe **ApplicationContext** is the container. At startup it scans for `@Component` and its specialisations (`@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`, `@RestController`), instantiates them, and wires them together by type.\n\nThere are three injection styles, and they are not equal:\n\n1. **Constructor injection — use this.** Dependencies become `final`, the object is impossible to construct in an invalid state, and testing needs no framework at all. Since Spring 4.3, a class with a single constructor needs no `@Autowired`.\n2. **Setter injection** — acceptable for genuinely optional dependencies.\n3. **Field injection** (`@Autowired` on the field) — avoid. Fields cannot be `final`, you cannot construct the object in a plain unit test, and it hides how many dependencies a class has, letting classes quietly grow bloated.\n\nWhen two beans implement the same interface, Spring cannot choose and startup fails. Disambiguate with **`@Primary`** on the default, or **`@Qualifier(\"name\")`** at the injection point.\n\n**Scopes** control lifecycle. The default `singleton` means one shared instance for the whole application — which is why **singleton beans must be stateless**. Mutable instance fields on a singleton service are shared across every concurrent request. `prototype` gives a new instance per injection; `request` and `session` apply to web applications.",

Following it means a new developer finds their way around in minutes.\n\nThe **layered** (package-by-layer) arrangement:\n\n```\ncom.skillofied.studentapi\n├── StudentApiApplication.java   <- main class, root package\n├── controller/    HTTP endpoints\n├── service/       business logic\n├── repository/    data access\n├── model/         JPA entities\n├── dto/           request and response shapes\n├── exception/     custom exceptions + @ControllerAdvice\n└── config/        @Configuration classes\n```\n\nThe non-negotiable rule: **the main class sits in the root package**, because `@ComponentScan` starts there. Anything in a sibling package is invisible to Spring.\n\nDependencies flow **strictly one way**: controller → service → repository. A repository must never call a service, and a controller must never touch a repository. This keeps layers independently testable and stops the codebase turning into a web of mutual calls.\n\n**Why DTOs?** It is tempting to return JPA entities straight from controllers, but that couples your public API to your database schema. Rename a column and you break every client. Worse, entities carry lazy associations that blow up during JSON serialisation, and they may contain fields — a password hash, an internal flag — that must never leave the server. A DTO is a plain object shaped for the API, mapped from the entity in the service layer.\n\nFor larger systems, **package-by-feature** (`student/`, `course/`, `enrolment/`, each containing its own controller, service and repository) scales better, because a change to one feature touches one directory instead of five.",

Boot detects it and auto-configures a `DataSource`.\n\n**The properties** live in `application.properties`. The essential four are the URL, username, password, and (usually inferred) driver class. Boot also configures **HikariCP** as the connection pool automatically — this matters, because opening a connection per request would cripple throughput. Hikari keeps a warm pool; tune it with `spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size`.\n\n**Schema management** is controlled by `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto`:\n\n- `none` — do nothing. **Correct for production.**\n- `validate` — verify entities match existing tables and fail fast if not. Excellent for production.\n- `update` — add missing tables and columns. Convenient in development, but it never drops or alters existing columns, so schemas drift.\n- `create-drop` — rebuild on startup, wipe on shutdown. Ideal for tests.\n\n**Never use `update` or `create-drop` in production.** For real schema evolution use a migration tool — Flyway or Liquibase — which versions changes in source control and applies them deterministically.\n\nThe **dialect** tells Hibernate which SQL flavour to generate.

        "theory": "These two names are constantly confused, and the distinction is a standard interview question.\n\n**JPA** (Jakarta Persistence API) is a **specification** — a set of interfaces and annotations (`@Entity`, `@Id`, `EntityManager`) with no implementation. **Hibernate** is the most popular **implementation** of that specification, and Spring Boot's default. Programming against JPA keeps you portable; Hibernate adds extras beyond the spec, at the cost of tying you to it.\n\n**ORM** (Object-Relational Mapping) is the problem they solve: objects have references and inheritance, tables have foreign keys and rows. ORM translates between them so you write Java instead of SQL.\n\nThe concept that explains most Hibernate behaviour is the **persistence context** — a first-level cache holding every entity the current transaction has loaded. Two consequences follow:\n\n1. Loading the same row twice in one transaction returns the **identical object**; the second call never hits the database.\n2. Hibernate performs **dirty checking**. It remembers each entity's loaded state and, at commit, compares. Any changed field is flushed as an UPDATE — **you never need to call `save()` on an entity that was loaded inside the transaction**. Simply setting a field is enough. This surprises everyone the first time.\n\nAn entity moves through four states:\n\n- **Transient** — created with `new`, unknown to Hibernate.\n- **Managed** — loaded or persisted, tracked by the persistence context, dirty-checked.\n- **Detached** — the context closed; changes are no longer tracked.\n- **Removed** — marked for deletion at flush.\n\n`LazyInitializationException` is what happens when you touch a lazy association on a **detached** entity — typically during JSON serialisation, after the transaction has already ended.",

        "theory": "**Entity mapping** declares how a Java class corresponds to a database table.\n\nThe basics: `@Entity` marks the class, `@Table(name=...)` names the table (defaulting to the class name), `@Id` marks the primary key, and `@GeneratedValue` chooses how it is produced. For MySQL and PostgreSQL auto-increment columns use `GenerationType.IDENTITY`.\n\nColumn-level control comes from `@Column(name, nullable, length, unique)`. Fields with no annotation are still mapped, using the field name. Use `@Transient` for a field you do *not* want persisted, and `@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)` for enums — **never** the default `ORDINAL`, which stores the enum's position and silently corrupts your data the day someone reorders the constants.\n\n**Relationships** are where the real design happens:\n\n- **`@OneToOne`** — a user and their profile.\n- **`@ManyToOne`** — many courses belong to one student. This is the **owning side**: it holds the foreign key, declared with `@JoinColumn`.\n- **`@OneToMany(mappedBy = \"...\")`** — the inverse side. `mappedBy` names the field on the owning side and means \"the foreign key lives over there\". Omit it and Hibernate creates a pointless extra join table.\n- **`@ManyToMany`** — students and courses, via a `@JoinTable`.\n\nTwo defaults worth memorising: `@ManyToOne` and `@OneToOne` are **EAGER**, while `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToMany` are **LAZY**. Those eager defaults are a frequent cause of accidental N+1 queries; most teams set `fetch = FetchType.LAZY` explicitly on the to-one sides.\n\n`cascade` propagates operations to associated entities, and `orphanRemoval = true` deletes children removed from a collection. Both are powerful and easy to misuse — `CascadeType.REMOVE` on the wrong association can delete far more than you intended.",

That is both unhelpful to clients and a **security problem**, because a stack trace reveals your package structure, framework versions, and sometimes SQL.\n\n**`@RestControllerAdvice`** solves this globally. It is a component whose `@ExceptionHandler` methods apply across every controller, so error handling lives in exactly one place and controllers stay clean — they simply throw, and the advice decides the HTTP response.\n\nThe pattern has three parts:\n\n1. **Custom exceptions** that carry meaning: `StudentNotFoundException`, `DuplicateEmailException`. Extend `RuntimeException` so they do not clutter method signatures — and remember `@Transactional` rolls back on unchecked exceptions.\n2. **A consistent error DTO** — timestamp, status, error, message, path. Clients can then parse errors reliably instead of pattern-matching on strings.\n3. **Handlers** mapping each exception to the right status: not-found → 404, duplicate → 409, validation → 400, access denied → 403.\n\nTwo rules matter for the catch-all `Exception` handler. **Log the full stack trace server-side** so you can debug, but **return a generic message** to the client — never `e.getMessage()`, which may embed a SQL fragment or file path. And keep the catch-all last; Spring picks the most specific matching handler, but an over-broad handler placed carelessly can swallow cases you meant to treat individually.\n\nAn alternative for simple cases is `@ResponseStatus` on the exception class itself, though it gives you no control over the body.",

A useful shorthand: authentication is showing your passport; authorization is whether that passport gets you through this particular gate.\n\nThere are two dominant mechanisms.\n\n**Session-based** authentication: the user logs in, the server creates a session, stores it in memory or Redis, and returns a session ID in a cookie. The server is **stateful** — it remembers you. Revoking access is trivial (delete the session), but scaling requires sticky sessions or shared session storage, and cookies bring CSRF risk.\n\n**Token-based** authentication: the server returns a signed token (typically a JWT) that the client sends in an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. The server is **stateless** — it verifies the signature and needs no stored session. This scales horizontally without coordination and suits mobile and third-party clients, which is why it dominates modern APIs. The trade-off is that a token is valid until it expires; you cannot easily revoke one without reintroducing state.\n\nIn Spring Security the key abstractions are the **`SecurityFilterChain`** (a chain of servlet filters every request passes through), **`Authentication`** (the current principal), and **`SecurityContextHolder`** (thread-local storage holding it).",

Mixing them is why rules mysteriously fail to match.\n\nThere are two places to enforce rules:\n\n**URL-based**, in the `SecurityFilterChain`. Rules are evaluated **top to bottom, first match wins** — so specific paths must come *before* general ones. Put `anyRequest().authenticated()` last, as a deny-by-default backstop. Ordering errors here are the most common security misconfiguration: a broad `permitAll()` placed early silently opens everything after it.\n\n**Method-based**, with `@PreAuthorize` on service methods, enabled by `@EnableMethodSecurity`.

It is three Base64URL-encoded parts joined by dots: `header.payload.signature`.\n\n- **Header** — the signing algorithm, e.g. `{\"alg\":\"HS256\",\"typ\":\"JWT\"}`.\n- **Payload** — the claims: `sub` (subject), `iat` (issued at), `exp` (expiry), plus your own such as roles.\n- **Signature** — `HMACSHA256(base64(header) + \".\" + base64(payload), secret)`.\n\nThe critical property, and the one most often misunderstood: **the payload is encoded, not encrypted.** Anyone can paste a JWT into jwt.io and read every claim. The signature guarantees *integrity* — that the content has not been altered — not *confidentiality*. **Never put a password, a card number, or any secret in a JWT payload.**\n\nThe flow is: client posts credentials → server validates and returns a signed token → client sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on subsequent requests → server verifies the signature and expiry, with no database lookup. That last point is the whole appeal: verification is a local computation, so any instance can serve any request.\n\nThe cost is **revocation**. A valid token stays valid until it expires; there is no session to delete. The standard mitigation is short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) paired with a long-lived **refresh token** that *is* stored server-side and can be revoked.\n\nOperationally: the signing secret must be long, random, and loaded from the environment — a hard-coded secret in a public repository is a total compromise.

        "theory": "Storing passwords correctly is the single highest-stakes decision in this module, because getting it wrong turns one database breach into a compromise of every user's other accounts.\n\nFirst, the vocabulary. **Encryption is reversible** — with the key you recover the plaintext. **Hashing is one-way** — you cannot invert it. Passwords must be **hashed, never encrypted**, because your system never needs the original. To verify a login you hash the submitted password and compare hashes.\n\nSecond, not all hashes are suitable. MD5 and SHA-256 are designed to be **fast**, which is exactly wrong here: a modern GPU computes billions of SHA-256 hashes per second, so an attacker brute-forces common passwords almost instantly. Password hashing needs a **deliberately slow** algorithm — BCrypt, SCrypt or Argon2.\n\n**BCrypt** is Spring Security's default and the pragmatic choice. Two properties matter:\n\n1. **Automatic salting.** A random salt is generated per password and stored inside the hash string itself. This is why hashing the same password twice produces two different outputs — and it defeats **rainbow tables**, since a precomputed table is useless against a unique salt.\n2. **A tunable work factor.** The strength parameter (default 10) sets 2^strength rounds. As hardware improves you raise it. Each increment doubles the cost for you and for an attacker.\n\nBecause the salt is embedded and each hash is unique, **you must never compare hashes with `equals()`**. Use `passwordEncoder.matches(raw, stored)`, which extracts the salt and re-derives the hash.\n\nOne operational detail: BCrypt silently truncates input beyond 72 bytes.",

A JWT sent in an `Authorization` header is not attached automatically, so a stateless token API is not vulnerable and disabling CSRF protection is correct. If you authenticate with cookies, **CSRF protection must stay on** — disabling it \"to make things work\" is a genuine vulnerability, and it is a common one.\n\n**CORS** is a different thing entirely, despite being confused with CSRF constantly.

        "theory": "A **JAR** is a ZIP archive of compiled classes and resources. Spring Boot produces a special kind: an **executable (fat, or uber) JAR** that contains your code, every dependency, and an embedded Tomcat. One file, `java -jar app.jar`, and the application is running. No application server to install, which is exactly what makes containerised deployment simple.\n\nThe `spring-boot-maven-plugin` performs the repackaging. `mvn package` first produces an ordinary JAR, then the plugin rewrites it into the Boot layout:\n\n```\napp.jar\n├── META-INF/MANIFEST.MF        <- Main-Class: JarLauncher\n├── org/springframework/boot/loader/   <- the launcher\n└── BOOT-INF/\n    ├── classes/                <- your code\n    └── lib/                    <- every dependency JAR\n```\n\nNested JARs are not something standard Java can load, which is why Boot ships its own `JarLauncher` as the manifest's `Main-Class`. It sets up a classloader that can read them, then calls your real main class.\n\nUseful commands: `mvn clean package` builds, `-DskipTests` skips tests (fine locally, never in CI), and `mvn spring-boot:build-image` produces an OCI container image with no Dockerfile at all.\n\nOne practical note: the plugin also keeps the pre-repackaging artefact as `app.jar.original`. If you deploy that by mistake you get \"no main manifest attribute\" — a confusing error with a simple cause.\n\nFor Docker, consider a **layered JAR** (enabled by default in recent versions), which splits dependencies from application code so image layers cache well and rebuilds stay small.",

        "theory": "The **twelve-factor** principle here is simple: **build once, deploy anywhere**. The same JAR should run in dev, staging and production, with only the environment differing. That means configuration must live outside the artefact.\n\nSpring Boot resolves properties from many sources in a defined **order of precedence**, highest first:\n\n1. Command-line arguments — `--server.port=9090`\n2. `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON`\n3. OS environment variables\n4. `application-{profile}.properties`\n5. `application.properties`\n6. Defaults in code\n\nHigher sources override lower ones, which is what makes the pattern work: commit sensible defaults, override them per environment.\n\n**The naming translation** trips everyone up once. An environment variable maps to a property by upper-casing and replacing dots and dashes with underscores. `spring.datasource.url` becomes `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`. This *relaxed binding* is why cloud platforms can configure Spring apps with nothing but environment variables.\n\nIn a properties file, reference them with `${VAR}` and supply a fallback with `${VAR:default}`.\n\n**Profiles** group environment-specific configuration. Put values in `application-dev.properties` and `application-prod.properties`, activate with `--spring.profiles.active=prod`, and Boot layers the profile file over the base one. `@Profile(\"prod\")` on a bean restricts it to that environment.\n\nFor type-safe access to a group of related properties, prefer **`@ConfigurationProperties`** over scattered `@Value` annotations — it validates at startup rather than failing at first use.\n\nThe security rule underneath all of this: **secrets never go in the repository**.

        "theory": "AWS offers several ways to run a Spring Boot JAR, and choosing well matters more than the mechanics.\n\n- **EC2** — a raw virtual machine. Maximum control, maximum operational burden: you patch the OS, configure the service, manage scaling.\n- **Elastic Beanstalk** — a managed platform. Upload the JAR and it provisions EC2, a load balancer, auto-scaling and health checks. **The best starting point.**\n- **ECS / Fargate** — run containers, with Fargate removing server management. The standard choice once you are containerised.\n- **Elastic Kubernetes Service** — full Kubernetes. Powerful, and overkill for a single service.\n- **Lambda** — serverless. Poorly suited to Spring Boot, whose startup time makes cold starts painful.\n\nA typical Beanstalk deployment is: build the JAR, create an application and environment on the *Corretto* platform, upload, and set environment variables in the console. Beanstalk expects your app on **port 5000**, so set `SERVER_PORT=5000` — missing this is the classic first-deployment failure, showing as a health check that never goes green.\n\nThe database belongs on **RDS**, provisioned separately rather than inside the Beanstalk environment, so that tearing down the environment does not destroy your data. Lock the RDS security group so it accepts connections only from your application's security group, never from the internet.\n\nProduction practices that are not optional: secrets in **Secrets Manager** or **Parameter Store**, not environment variables in the console; HTTPS terminated at the load balancer with an **ACM** certificate; logs shipped to **CloudWatch**; health checks pointed at `/actuator/health`; and auto-scaling configured on CPU.",

        "theory": "**Render** is a platform-as-a-service that connects to a Git repository, builds on push, and runs the result. Compared with AWS it trades fine-grained control for a dramatically shorter path to a running application — which makes it ideal for student projects, portfolios and MVPs.\n\nThe deployment model is straightforward. Connect your GitHub repository, choose a **Web Service**, and give Render two commands:\n\n- **Build command** — `./mvnw clean package -DskipTests`\n- **Start command** — `java -jar target/student-api.jar`\n\nRender then builds on every push to the tracked branch, giving you continuous deployment for free.\n\nThe one platform-specific detail that matters: **Render assigns the port through a `PORT` environment variable**, and your service must bind to it. Set `server.port=${PORT:8080}` and you work both locally and on Render. Binding to a hard-coded 8080 means the health check never passes and the deploy is marked failed — this is the single most common Render mistake, and it is the same class of error as Beanstalk's port 5000.\n\nRender offers **managed PostgreSQL**. Create the database, then reference its internal connection string from the web service. Use the *internal* URL — it does not traverse the public internet and is faster.\n\nTwo caveats to plan around. The **free tier spins down after inactivity**, so the next request pays a cold start of thirty seconds or more; use a paid instance for anything real. And the filesystem is **ephemeral** — anything written to disk disappears on redeploy, so uploads belong in S3 or an equivalent, never on local disk.\n\nAll of this can be committed as a `render.yaml` blueprint, which makes the infrastructure reproducible and reviewable.",

Because the image contains everything, it behaves identically on your laptop, in CI, and in production — the definitive answer to \"it works on my machine\".\n\nA container is not a virtual machine. It shares the host kernel and isolates only the process and filesystem, which is why it starts in milliseconds and costs megabytes rather than gigabytes.\n\n**Write a multi-stage Dockerfile.** The build stage needs Maven and the full JDK; the runtime stage needs only a JRE. Copying just the JAR from the build stage into a slim base image typically takes the result from ~700 MB down to under 200 MB. Smaller images pull faster, start faster, and expose less attack surface.\n\n**Order layers for caching.** Docker caches each instruction and invalidates everything after the first change. Copy `pom.xml` and download dependencies *before* copying `src`. Then a source-only change reuses the cached dependency layer, turning a three-minute rebuild into fifteen seconds.\n\n**Do not run as root.** Create an unprivileged user and switch to it with `USER`. If the container is compromised, the attacker inherits that user's limited rights.\n\n**Never bake secrets into an image.** Every `ENV` and every build argument is visible in the image history to anyone who can pull it. Pass secrets at runtime.\n\nA `.dockerignore` keeps `target/`, `.git/` and IDE files out of the build context — often shrinking it by an order of magnitude.\n\n**Docker Compose** then runs the whole stack — application plus database — with one command, using `depends_on` with a health condition so the app waits for the database to be genuinely ready rather than merely started.",
